## Ah yes, the classic U.S States Game
Made using the python turtle module, and me learning how to use CSV and pandas libaray


Basically, type in the name of the U.S State, and that name will appear on/next to that state until you've successfully listed all 50 of them

Typing 'exit' into the prompt box will close the program, and will produce a .csv file with the list of all states you've missed so you can study them.
